The 2024 ACM Europe School on Recommender Systems will be held from Tuesday, October 8, to Saturday, October 12, in Bari, Italy. Leaders in the field will give lectures on the practice, research, and state of the art in recommender systems. The lectures are covering a broad range of topics from an algorithmic as well as a methodological perspective and will also include hands-on sessions. 

The ACM Europe School on Recommender Systems is supported by [ACM RecSys](http://recsys.acm.org) and [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/).
