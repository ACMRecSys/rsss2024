The 2024 RecSys summer school will be held from Tuesday, October 8, to Saturday, October 12, in Bari, Italy. Leaders in the field will give lectures on the practice, research, and state of the art in recommender systems. The lectures are covering a broad range of topics from an algorithmic as well as a methodological perspective and will also include hands-on sessions. 

The Summer School on Recommender Systems is supported by [ACM RecSys](http://recsys.acm.org), [ACM Europe Council](https://europe.acm.org/), and [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/).
The RecSys Summer School follows previous summer schools on the same topic having taken place in Bilbao in 2006, [Bolzano in 2017](https://pro.unibz.it/projects/schoolrecsys17/), [Gothenburg in 2019](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/), [Fortaleza in 2019](https://sbbd.org.br/lars2019/), and [Copenhagen in 2023](http://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2023).
