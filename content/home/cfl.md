We are currently seeking experienced and knowledgeable speakers to deliver lectures on various topics related to recommender systems. If you are an expert in the recommender system field and are interested in contributing to our summer school, we invite you to submit a proposal for a lecture.
Each lecture will be approximately **90 minutes** long (it is possible to extend to a **maximum of 180 minutes** if motivated), including time for questions and discussions. We encourage speakers to provide practical insights, case studies, and examples to enhance the learning experience for participants.

## Categories
Each proposal should fall under one of the following categories: *foundational*, *introductory*, or *advanced* topics.

* **Foundational topics**
Foundational topics present the basics of a research area to the students who have yet to gain prior knowledge in that area. They should be at an elementary level, without prerequisites in the lecture’s topic, though possibly assuming a level of general scientific maturity in the relevant discipline. They should enable researchers from related disciplines to become comfortable with the fundamental concepts and techniques of the lecture topic, thereby contributing to the interdisciplinary nature of our research community.

* **Introductory topics**
  Introductory topics are central to RecSys’s mission. They are intended to introduce a research field to students, young researchers, and non-specialists and foster a sound understanding of its basic methods and techniques. Introductory topics should enable researchers from related disciplines to become competent in the lecture topic. Introductory topics that are cross-disciplinary may presuppose general knowledge of the relevant disciplines.

* **Advanced topics**
Advanced topics are targeted primarily at PhD students and attendees who wish to understand current research in the field of Recommender Systems.
